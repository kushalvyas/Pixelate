# Pixelate 

This is a bot I made for an image processing competition
The input is a 6 x 6 grid of shapes .Where each shape will denote a 
direction/constraint the bot has to follow .

Analyzing the image , we need to obtain a path from START to END and make the 
bot follow it.

Black Square : Continue travelling straight
Blue Square : Continue travelling straight
Red Square : Dead End
Triangle : Take a turn in the direction the triangle points
Quad : Bot can move in any of 4 directions


HardWare Implementation :
AVR Atmega 128 board

Software Implementation :
OpenCV , Python



Note : Pixelate problem statement was under IIT Bombay TechFest Competition
